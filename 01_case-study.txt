This are the initial steps that I have taken to anticipate the situation:

1. Assess the process of the third-party software
2. Outlines the procedures for addressing changes or discontinuation of the support. 
3. Establish regular communication with the third-party software providers to stay informed about development plans and any potential changes that may impact support.
4. Develop plans to address where third-part-support is discontinued or changes unxepectedly. 
5. Continuous monitoring and assessment.
